## Faster, cheaper DR with Terraform
If you could stand up your disaster recovery environment in 10 minutes, it may not make sense to keep it running all the time. The cloud enables you to stand up infrastructure on demand, and that's where Terraform comes in. Terraform can help you very quickly stand up a new infrastructure or new production environments in a different region or even on a different cloud provider in a very short period of time.
